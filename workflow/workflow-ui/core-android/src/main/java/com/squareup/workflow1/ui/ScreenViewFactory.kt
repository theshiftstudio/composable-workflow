/**
 * Transforms a [ScreenViewFactory] of [WrappedT] into one that can handle

 *
 * This a simpler variant of the like named function that takes two arguments, for
 * use when there is no need to customize the [view][ScreenViewHolder.view] or
 * the [environment][ScreenViewHolder.environment].
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * To make one rendering type an "alias" for another -- that is, to use the
 * same [ScreenViewFactory] to display it:
 *
 *    class RealScreen(val data: String): Screen
 *    object RealScreenViewFactory = ScreenViewFactory.fromLayout(...)
 *
 *    class AliasScreen(val similarData: String) : Screen
 *
 *    object AliasScreenViewFactory =
 *      RealScreenViewFactory.unwrapping<AliasScreen, RealScreen> { aliasScreen ->
 *        RealScreen(aliasScreen.similarData)
 *      }
 *
 * To make one rendering type a wrapper for others:
 *
 *    class Wrapper<W>(val wrapped: W: Screen) : Screen, Compatible {
 *      override val compatibilityKey = Compatible.keyFor(wrapped)
 *    }
 *
 *    fun <W : Screen> WrapperViewFactory() =
 *      ScreenViewFactory.forBuiltView<Wrapper<W>> { wrapper, env, context, container ->
 *        // Get the view factory of the wrapped screen.
 *        wrapper.wrapped.toViewFactory(env)
 *          // Transform it to factory that accepts Wrapper<W>
 *          .unwrapping<Wrapper<W>, W> { it.wrapped }
 *          // Delegate to the transformed factory to build the view.
 *          .buildView(wrapper, env, context, container)
 *      }
 *
 * To make a wrapper that adds information to the [ViewEnvironment]:
 *
 *    class NeutronFlowPolarity(val reversed: Boolean) {
 *      companion object : ViewEnvironmentKey<NeutronFlowPolarity>(
 *        NeutronFlowPolarity::class
 *      ) {
 *        override val default: NeutronFlowPolarity =
 *          NeutronFlowPolarity(reversed = false)
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 *    class OverrideNeutronFlow<W : Screen>(
 *      val wrapped: W,
 *      val polarity: NeutronFlowPolarity
 *    ) : Screen, Compatible {
 *      override val compatibilityKey: String = Compatible.keyFor(wrapped)
 *    }
 *
 *    fun <W : Screen> OverrideNeutronFlowViewFactory() =
 *      ScreenViewFactory.forBuiltView<OverrideNeutronFlow<W>> { wrapper, env, context, container ->
 *        // Get the view factory of the wrapped screen.
 *        wrapper.wrapped.toViewFactory(env)
 *          // Transform it to factory that accepts OverrideNeutronFlow<W>, by
 *          // replacing the OverrideNeutronFlow<W> with an EnvironmentScreen<W>
 *          .unwrapping<OverrideNeutronFlow<W>, EnvironmentScreen<W>> {
 *            it.wrapped.withEnvironment(
 *              Environment.EMPTY + (NeutronFlowPolarity to it.polarity)
 *            )
 *          }
 *          // Delegate to the transformed factory to build the view.
 *          .buildView(wrapper, env, context, container)
 *      }
 *
 * @param unwrap a function to extract [WrappedT] instances from [WrapperT]s.
